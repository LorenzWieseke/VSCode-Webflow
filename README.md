# VS Code Project

## Description

This project helps users write code in VS Code and use it inside Webflow.

Simply edit the code in the index.js inside the src folder. 

The files inside the scr folder will be bundled and served in the dist folder. 

Then just copy the line <script src="http://localhost:3000/global.js"></script> to your page settings in Webflow and publish your page. 

Any changes you make in the code will update directly on your page.
